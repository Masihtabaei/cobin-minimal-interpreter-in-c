## General Information

Here you will find a minimal interpreter written in C (which I used in an embedded systems console based project).
It supports basic arithmetic operations (number + number | number - number | number * number | number / number  \[only integer divisions\]) for positive numbers and can get used to raise a number to a positive exponent (number ** exponent). 
In addition it supports an unlimited number of brackets which can get nested in an arbitrary way.

I created this interpreter over the night in summer of 2023 for using in one of my embedded systems projects.
I called it **cobin**. **cobin** is a partial blend (**Coburg** \[name of a small city located in Bavaria in Southern Germany\] + **Interpreter** )
Feel free to extend/adjust this project so that it meets your goals.

## Usage/Example

Just run the project in Code::Blocks. Then you can enter your expressions which then get
evaluated instantly (similar to interactive mode in Python).
